# Kahoot Spammer

This is a Kahoot Spammer made in Python 3. This can be used to mess with everyone's favorite game, Kahoot. 

## Getting Started

First off, you will need to install Python 3 from their <a href = "https://www.python.org/">official website</a>. Once Python is installed, you will need the selenium package. You can download the selenium package by executing the following command in your terminal. 

```
python -m pip install selenium
```

## Run It!

Once you have successfully installed python and the required packages, you can open the kahoot_flood.py file with python and run the program!
