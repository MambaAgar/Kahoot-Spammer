# Kahoot Spammer

This is a Kahoot Spammer made in Python 3. This can be used to mess with everyone's favorite game, Kahoot. 

## Getting Started

First off, you will need to install Python 3 from their <a href = "https://www.python.org/">official website</a>. Once Python is installed, you will need the selenium package. You can download the selenium package by executing the following command in your terminal. 

```
python -m pip install selenium
```

## Run It!

Once you have successfully installed python, the required packages, and all of the files in this repository, you can open the kahoot_flood.py file with python and run the program!

Please feel free to make a new issue in the issue tab if you have any questions or comments. 

## FAQ

Q.) What is phantomjs?
<br>
A.) <a href = "http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> is a headless browser, used for programs like this. Headless means that you don't actually see the browser, like you will with Google Chrome or Firefox, but it's still there. It is included in the repository for your convenience.

Q.) Can you make the program answer as well?
<br>
A.) That is something that I am currently working on. Check back later for more updates.
